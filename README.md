# The Rico Manifesto - 02-23-2020
This repository contains the chops from [The Rico Manifesto](https://www.facebook.com/rico.mayes/videos/3029584257073061/) which was a "Facebook Live" by [Rico "OnDa Trak" Mayes](https://soundcloud.com/slumlordz) of [Rock Hill, SC](https://goo.gl/maps/HR3DfuXz3T5X7sd89). Rico's manifesto was the result of hearing someone claiming to be "**The Best in Town**". The artist making this statement was actually one of many artists across the country that sound like everybody else on the radio. People defending this artist stated that he has released a more than average amount of songs which makes him the best. This struck a nerve in Old Heads like Rico, myself and others. So, I listened to the entire Manifesto (Thrice), the third time I felt that this moment was monumental enough that it required some action on my part.

# Quality over Quantity
The quantity over quality equation is wrong and only increases the problems in how Hip Hop is viewed and lived. The radio is full of unoriginal tracks produced by some great beat makers and producers who themselves have settled on being unoriginal. The result of this makes the artists selecting those beats also sound unoriginal. Then radio, social media, and all of the streaming service push this product on to consumers as a means to promote their streaming brands or radio ranking. The end result is unoriginal content being mass produced, which has us all consuming a bunch of garbage from a bunch of Clones. The true equation is **Quality over Quantity**, knowing your craft, pushing the bounds of creativity/expression and expecting more from each other as both fans and creators of this music we call Hip Hop.

# The Work
I took the entire "Rico Manifesto", recorded it into [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) from Facebook then chopped it up by hand, true wave-form editing by simply selecting and saving each selection-as it's own Sample. I created Samples of the "Truth" Rico was speaking in his Manifesto, (you may find your own truth in it as well), the final result was 128 phrase samples from his manifesto that can be used on tracks going forward to remind people to stay focused and to be original.

# The Manifesto as a Tool
### 128 Chops for your Tracks
This repo of samples originally should be used by both the old school heads and current beat makers on tracks in Rock Hill or anywhere else that Cloning is happening (which seems to be everywhere on radio and online). My hope is that people in Rock Hill and the surrounding areas will remember "**The Rico Manifesto**" and start being original artist, beat makers, DJs and listeners/supporters of the nation of Hip Hop.

# The Files
The files are .WAV files for true sound of 16 bit with no effects. The chops are in the **Manifesto Chops** folder, there are 128 of them to use.

I used no certain order, just basic naming the sample for what it said or what it's intent was. Each file contains Meta data giving Rico credit for his work, speaking the truth.

Please add effects, chop it more, scratch it and mix them till the Cloning stops. I also included in the **original** folder an mp3 of the Original Manifesto I recorded from Facebook. 

### Old Heads Unite, Hip Hop Unite, Be Original.

# Share
Please share this link with other like minded Hip Hop Heads that think the Cloning needs to stop.
